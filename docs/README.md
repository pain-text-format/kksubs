## Subtitle projects
A *subtitle project* is made up of the following items:
```
- images (required)
- drafts (required)
- output (optional)
- styles.yml (optional)
```
Drafts are the main way of adding content to an image. The following items are arranged in decreasing priority, i.e. read how the draft works first.

1. [Editing a draft](subtitle_project/draft.md)
1. [Editing the styles file](subtitle_project/style_file.md)
1. [Style fields](subtitle_project/styles.md)

## Command line tools
Commands are the primary way of adding subtitles for a subtitle project.

1. [kkp command line](command_line/kkp.md): subtitle project management and integration with the Koikatsu Party/Chara Studio game; extends `kksubs`.
